# WhatsNewKit

A reusable SwiftUI "What's New" sheet for iOS and macOS apps in the HK Softworks portfolio.

## Requirements

- iOS 26+ / macOS 26+
- Swift 6.2+

## Installation

No release tags are published yet, so use the `master` branch for now:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/hksw-io/WhatsNewKit.git", branch: "master")
```

Switch to a semantic version requirement after the first release tag exists:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/hksw-io/WhatsNewKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

Or in Xcode: **File > Add Package Dependencies**, enter the URL above, and select the `master` branch until a release tag is available.

## Usage

Implement `WhatsNewContent` with your app's strings and icon, then present the view:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import WhatsNewKit

struct MyWhatsNew: WhatsNewContent {
    var appIcon: Image? { Image("AppIconImage") }
    var title: Text { Text("What's New in MyApp") }
    var features: [WhatsNewFeature] {
        [
            WhatsNewFeature(
                id: "new-charts",
                systemImage: "chart.line.uptrend.xyaxis.circle",
                label: "New Charts",
                description: "Track your progress with redesigned charts."),
        ]
    }
    var notice: WhatsNewNotice? {
        WhatsNewNotice(text: Text("Plus many other improvements."))
    }
    var buttonText: Text { Text("Continue") }
}

struct RootView: View {
    @State private var isShowing = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView()
            .sheet(isPresented: $isShowing) {
                WhatsNewView(content: MyWhatsNew()) {
                    isShowing = false
                }
            }
    }
}
```

## Backgrounds

The default background is the system sheet surface. Use `whatsNewBackground(_:)` when an app needs a more branded release note experience:

```swift
WhatsNewView(content: MyWhatsNew()) {
    isShowing = false
}
.whatsNewBackground(.softGradient)
```

Built-in options:

- `.system` — the default platform background.
- `.softGradient` — a restrained blue/mint background tuned for readable content.
- `.linearGradient(colors:startPoint:endPoint:)` — app-provided colors with the library-managed footer treatment.
- `.animatedMesh(primary:secondary:accent:)` — an opt-in smooth full-surface animated gradient. It keeps a tinted base across the whole sheet and automatically becomes static when Reduce Motion is enabled.
- `.custom { context in ... }` — a fully custom SwiftUI background. Use `context.reduceMotion` to keep custom animations accessible.

Every background spans behind the pinned footer and button area, including `.system`.

## Styling

Use `whatsNewStyle(_:)` to override foreground, tint, and button colors while keeping the library's layout, typography, and motion:

```swift
WhatsNewView(content: MyWhatsNew()) {
    isShowing = false
}
.whatsNewStyle(WhatsNewStyle(
    tint: .indigo,
    titleColor: .primary,
    featureIconColor: .mint,
    featureDescriptionColor: .secondary,
    noticeColor: .secondary,
    buttonForegroundColor: .white))
```

`WhatsNewBackground` controls the surface behind the sheet content. `WhatsNewStyle` controls foreground roles such as title, feature rows, notice text, and button text. Any color you leave as `nil` uses the standard system treatment. `tint` controls the prominent button accent and is also used by feature icons unless `featureIconColor` is set.

## Version tracking

Give every `WhatsNewFeature` a stable `id`. Stable IDs let SwiftUI preserve row identity when features are inserted, removed, or reordered.

`WhatsNewVersionTracker` persists the last-shown version in `UserDefaults` and decides whether to present the sheet on launch:

```swift
let tracker = WhatsNewVersionTracker(
    keyPrefix: "com.example.myapp",
    currentVersion: "1.2.0")

if tracker.shouldShowWhatsNew() {
    // present WhatsNewView
}

// after dismiss:
tracker.markAsShown()
```

The first launch after install is treated as "not new" — users see the sheet only on subsequent version upgrades.

## Local development

Run the package tests from the package root:

```sh
swift test
```

In the local `hksw` workspace, preview both libraries with the sibling preview host:

```sh
cd ../PreviewHost
swift run
```
